# Quick-Quiz

I failed so many times but i finally got it . In this Challenge i was suppose to build a quick quiz uisng HTML,CSS and JavaScript. 

I have 5 questions about JS and once you're done with the quiz you are able to set you high score with your initials.

Every time you asnwer wrong, it will alert you and take 10 seconds off your time.

I think i hit all the Acceptance Criteria
* 5 questions 
* Muliple Answers 
* High Score
* Time penalty


Have Fun !!!
